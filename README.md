# Mangle

A string manipulation library. There's a few things I found myself doing over and over again
that while useful, will never be in Elixir's `String` library. So here they are.

**WARNING** This is *super* alpha right now. What that means is that I haven't worked out
all the edge cases and this can probably all be done better. That will come shortly though.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mangle` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mangle, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/mangle](https://hexdocs.pm/mangle).
